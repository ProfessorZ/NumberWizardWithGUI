# NumberWizardWithGUI
Complete Unity Developer Course Section 4 project

Added settings screen, can change min and max and difficulty.
Basically this game asks you to pick a number, remember it, and then it tries to guess the number, 
with you telling the 'game' whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the number in your head.

This was made while following the 
Learn To Code by Making Games - The Complete Unity Developer course on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/).
